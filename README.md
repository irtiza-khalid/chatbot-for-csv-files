# CSV Chatbot Using RAG Model

Welcome to the CSV Chatbot project! This project leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to create a chatbot that interacts with CSV files, extracting and generating content-based responses using state-of-the-art language models.

## Project Overview

This chatbot is designed to interact with CSV files, using a combination of advanced language models and retrieval techniques. The core of the project is built on the Mistral 7 Billion parameter LLM from Hugging Face, enabling it to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the content of the CSV files.

## Key Features

- **RAG Model Integration:** Combines retrieval and generation for high-quality responses.
- **Mistral LLM:** Utilizes a 7 Billion parameter language model from Hugging Face.
- **CSV Processing:** Loads and processes CSV files using LangChain CSVLoader.
- **Content Embedding:** Creates embeddings using Hugging Face models for precise retrieval.
- **Custom Prompting:** Designed prompts to enhance content retrieval accuracy.
- **Query and Response:** Interacts with the LLM model to generate responses based on CSV content.
- **Evaluation:** Uses llama index from Uptonic for evaluating model performance.
